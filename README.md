Hello Ensolvers! I am Brayan Zavala.

This challenge has been quite difficult but it was finally achieved!
Below you will find all the information you need to know about this notes app.

Before running either project make sure to use the "npm install" command to get all the package.json dependencies.

First of all the frontend is developed with React + Vite
React version: ^18.2.0.
Vite version: ^5.0.8.
To run the project you will only need to use the "npm run dev" command.

While the backend is developed with NodeJS as the execution environment, ExpressJS for managing the RESTful API and MySQL as a relational database, this project is using the MVC architecture.

NodeJS Version: v22.0.0.
Npm Version: 10.5.1.
ExpressJS Version: ^4.19.2.

Also included is an sh file that starts both backend and frontend projects in a Linux/macOS environment.
"setup-project-ubuntu.sh"
This script is designed to streamline the setup process for a development environment containing MySQL, a backend (presumably Node.js-based), and a frontend (likely using React with Vite). It ensures MySQL is installed and configured, sets up the backend and frontend environments, and starts both applications automatically for development purposes.

The full stack application is deployed on AWS EC2 with the following address:
http://18.217.6.15/
